# File-translator
I developed a machine learning based translation application using python and tkinter GUI. 
This helps to transform the source text corpus into the desired language.
In this project, I combined the power of python and the GUI tool kit - Tkinter and Machine translation to create a seamless file translation that helps in translating files into multiple languages.

In this project for translation I used googletrans library that is helpful in bulk translations and is fast and reliable. 
The tkinter gui is used to display the source file corpus and target file corpus in the preferred language. 
It lets you upload a text file from the system and by selecting source and target languages, you can easily translate with few clicks.
You can also download the translated text.

I also added some error handling mechanisms to display helpful messages if the procedure of translation is not performed properly such as if the source,target languages are not selected,reuploading the file, uploading the empty file, trying to download the target file before translating etc..
